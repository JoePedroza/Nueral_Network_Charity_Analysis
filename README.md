# Nueral_Network_Charity_Analysis

Run a deep learning model to predict whether an applicant will be succesful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  We will use dataset of organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup over the years.

# Deep learning (nueral networs) steps to analyze our dataset.

-Import dependencies.
-Import the input dataset.
-Generate categorical variable list.
-Create a OneHotEncoder instance.
-Fit and transform the OneHotEncoder.
-Add the encoded variable names to the DataFrame.
-Merge one-hot encoded features and drop the originals.
-Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays.
-Split the preprocessed data into training and testing dataset.
-Create a StandardScaler instance.
-Fit the StandardScaler.
-Scale the data.
-Define the model.
-Add first and second hidden layers.
-Add the output layer.
-Check the structure of the model.
